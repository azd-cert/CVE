## Meta
During the preparation of one of our incident response exercises, we detected an unexpected behavior of the Joomla Module JE Messenger of Harmis Technology in its current version (1.2.2). Due to this behavior, we started analyzing this module and detected several vulnerabilities.

We informed the software-vendor that we have detected vulnerabilities in their module. Sadly a secure communication to share the details could not be established.

Since we still want to disclose our findings in a responsible way, we will only announce the type of vulnerability and the associated risk in the first step. This gives the software vendor time to patch the plugin or user the time to move to another plugin or temporarily disable it. We will publish more details including some payloads on 2019-05-01.
